# DU Zone-A Security “ALERT” System

## Introduction

This is a simple icon-driven security system to alert the guards when there is
a security situation requiring guards attention. It is like a “panic” button on
your smartphone.

## Registration

There are basically three groups of people involved:

1) Security guards who are the **responders** to any alert generated by the
system. Some committee members and some community patrolling members will be
added as responders so that they are aware of the situation and if necessary,
offer additional help.

2) Residents who are security members can register with their name, address,
phone number and any identification (like last 4 or 6 digits of their IC or any
reference number you prefer). Then they should create an icon which they can
use to trigger an alert when required.

3) DU Zone A Committee will be the manager and administrator of the system.
They can remove or replace any guard or resident registered whenever necessary.

## ALERT Process

A resident will activate an alert by pressing the ALERT icon created on his
smartphone.  Responder(s) upon receiving a text message showing the address,
name, phone number of person who press the ALERT icon (e.g. the message will
look like  02 SS21/5, person-name, person-phone number, time of trigger) will
proceed to the address as soon as possible to deal with the situation.

Management will periodically review the alerts generated and follow up to
understand the nature of the alerts and how they were handled. This review will
generate learning points on how to deal with the different types of alerts
better in future.

## ADVANTAGE & USAGE

You don’t have to remember the hotline number.  It is like the equivalent of a
“Panic” button. Please test it once and then use it when there is a real
security situation that needs the guard’s attention. Usage of this tool is
restricted to members only.
