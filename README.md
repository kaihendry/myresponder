# MyResponder

An opensource PHP project to help dispatch local **guards** in gated
communities by SMS to a **home owner**'s address.

There are three parties involved in this system:

1. Guard (also known as "first responder")
2. Home owner
3. Management

Management's task is to approve by "arming" who can raise alerts and who can receive them.

Other features:

* Every alert or incident is recorded in one JSON file. Logging incidents gives you the metrics to improve!
* Optional ability to time track guards, providing the "clock out"
